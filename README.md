# Introduction to DevOps and Site Reliability Engineering

## 1 - Introduction to DevOps and SRE

### What is DevOps and Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)?

DevOps (Development + Operations) is a set of practices, principles, and cultural philosophies that aim to enhance collaboration and communication between software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) teams. The primary goal is to automate and streamline the processes of software delivery and infrastructure changes, fostering a culture of continuous improvement and faster, more reliable releases.

Site Reliability Engineering, or SRE, is a discipline that incorporates aspects of software engineering and applies them to infrastructure and operations problems. It was developed at Google to create scalable and highly reliable software systems.

DevOps and SRE are two different disciplines of Software Engineering, but they are deeply interconnected and rely on each other for success. DevOps focuses on creating new features and improvements, while SRE focuses on ensuring the reliability and stability of the system. Both DevOps and SRE require strong collaboration and communication to achieve common goals. Anyone interested in a career in tech should consider exploring both DevOps and SRE to understand the full picture of software development and delivery.

In this course, we will provide an understanding of what DevOps and SRE are all about and how they work together to create successful software products. Let’s look at a simplified analogy to understand better.

Imagine you're a chef in a busy restaurant. You're responsible for creating delicious dishes, but you can't do it alone. You need someone to help you gather ingredients, prepare the kitchen, and even clean up afterwards. That's where the kitchen assistant comes in.

DevOps and SRE are like the chef and the kitchen assistant in the tech world.

DevOps (Development + Operations) is the chef, focusing on creating new features and improvements. They're constantly innovating and experimenting, trying out new recipes and cooking techniques.

SRE (Site Reliability Engineering) is the kitchen assistant, ensuring everything runs smoothly behind the scenes. They're responsible for setting up the kitchen, maintaining the equipment, and creating workflows that make the chef's job easier.

By working together, DevOps and SRE ensure that the restaurant runs smoothly, delicious dishes are consistently cooked and served, and customers are always satisfied.

Before we deep dive into the world of DevOps and SRE, let's look at some of the existing challenges which led to DevOps culture and principles.

### Characteristics of Traditional Software Development

The pre-DevOps era in software development was a starkly different landscape than what we see today. It was a time of siloed teams, rigid methodologies, and a lot of manual work, which often led to slow and unreliable software delivery.

Here are some key characteristics of the pre-DevOps era:

- Waterfall Model  
    The dominant methodology was the Waterfall model, a linear approach where each stage had to be completed before moving on to the next. This made it difficult to adapt to changes and respond quickly to new requirements.
- Siloed Teams  
    Developers, testers, and operations teams worked independently, often with little communication or collaboration. This created a "throw it over the wall" mentality, where each team blamed the other for problems.
- Manual Processes  
    Most tasks, from testing to deployment, were done manually. This was time-consuming and error-prone, leading to delays and inconsistencies.
- Limited Automation  
    There were few tools available to automate repetitive tasks, making it difficult to scale software development.
- Slow and Unreliable Delivery  
    Releases were infrequent and often buggy, causing frustration for both developers and users.

Next, let’s take a look at some specific examples of the challenges faced in the pre-DevOps era.

In April 2011, the Sony PlayStation Network (PSN) experienced a massive outage that lasted for 23 days and affected over 100 million users. This incident is considered a classic example of the challenges faced in the pre-DevOps era and serves as a cautionary tale for organizations transitioning to modern development practices.

The PSN outage was caused by a series of security breaches that exploited vulnerabilities in the network infrastructure. The incident highlighted several key issues:

- Lack of Communication  
    The security team identified vulnerabilities but failed to communicate them effectively to the operations team, leading to delays in patching the systems.

- Manual Processes  
    Many security patches and updates were applied manually, increasing the risk of human error and slowing down the response time.

- Inadequate Monitoring  
    The lack of real-time monitoring and alerting systems meant that the security breaches went undetected for an extended period, allowing the attackers to gain access to sensitive data.

- Slow Incident Response  
    When the breaches were finally detected, the incident response was slow and ineffective, exacerbating the impact on users and the company's reputation.

The PSN outage was a wake-up call for many organizations, highlighting the need for a more collaborative, automated, and reliable approach to software development and operations. This incident, along with others like it, paved the way for the rise of DevOps and SRE as modern practices to address these challenges.

The launch of the United States Department of Health and Human Services' healthcare.gov website in 2013 was plagued by technical problems, causing major delays and embarrassment for the government. This was due in part to the use of outdated technology and a lack of collaboration between development and operations teams.

The pre-DevOps era was a time of significant challenges for software development. However, it also laid the groundwork for the emergence of DevOps, which has revolutionized the way software is built and delivered.
